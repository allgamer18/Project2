# Project2
Project2 for COSC 331
This is a rest api project for my COSC 331 Networking class.

The html front end takes data in the form of  a first name,
last name, email, company, and phone number.
The front end then sends the data to a back end where
it takes the data and saves it to a database in MongoDB.

Requirements:
    MongoDB
    Interenet access of some kind

Steps to run the program are as follows:

Step 1: Download the project2.1 zip file along with the html file and the CSS file.
Step 2: Open the project2.1 file and use "npm start" in the console to start the server.
Step 3: Open your MongoDB connection.
Step 4: Open the html file in your preferred browser and fill in the required text boxes.
Step 5: The data will then be populated to your database, continue as long as you want to!
